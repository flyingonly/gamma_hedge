# Data Quality Statistics Tool - Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The option data CSV export was showing 0 data points for all options, which was incorrect.

## Root Cause
The original code was looking for fields named 'underlying_prices' or 'prices' in the NPZ files, but the actual options data was stored in:
- `data_count` field: Contains the exact number of data points
- `data` field: Contains the actual data array with shape (n_rows, n_columns)

## Solution Implemented
Updated the data extraction logic in `csv_process/data_quality_statistics.py`:

```python
# OLD (incorrect):
if 'underlying_prices' in data.files:
    prices = data['underlying_prices']
    option_stats['data_points'] = len(prices)
elif 'prices' in data.files:
    prices = data['prices']
    option_stats['data_points'] = len(prices)
else:
    option_stats['data_points'] = 0

# NEW (correct):
if 'data_count' in data.files:
    option_stats['data_points'] = int(data['data_count'].item())
elif 'data' in data.files:
    data_array = data['data']
    if hasattr(data_array, 'shape') and len(data_array.shape) > 0:
        option_stats['data_points'] = data_array.shape[0]
    else:
        option_stats['data_points'] = 0
else:
    option_stats['data_points'] = 0
```

## Results After Fix

### Data Coverage Now Shows Correctly:
- 3CN5: 42/42 options have data
- 3CQ5: 42/42 options have data  
- 3IN5: 34/34 options have data
- 3IQ5: 36/36 options have data
- 3MN5: 41/41 options have data
- 3MQ5: 42/42 options have data
- 3WN5: 15/15 options have data
- 3WQ5: 25/25 options have data

### Sample Data Points (Previously 0, Now Correct):
- 3CN5/CALL_111.0: 43 data points
- 3CN5/CALL_111.5: 46 data points
- 3CN5/CALL_112.0: 117 data points
- 3CN5/CALL_112.5: 139 data points

### Time Information Also Extracted:
Added logic to extract start_time, end_time, and duration_days from the actual data timestamps.

## Verification
- Total options: 277 (correctly exported to CSV)
- All options now show actual data point counts instead of zeros
- Data coverage statistics are accurate
- Time range information is properly extracted from data arrays
