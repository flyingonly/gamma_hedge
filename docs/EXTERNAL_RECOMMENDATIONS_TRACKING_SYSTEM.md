## Current Recommendations Registry

### Active External Recommendations

#### EXT-2025-08-19-AI-001: Reward Signal Implementation Fix
- **Source**: External AI Analysis (ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Priority**: N/A (REJECTED)
- **Category**: ARCHITECTURE + FUNCTIONALITY
- **Complexity**: COMPLEX
- **Risk**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: 1-2 WEEKS

**Summary**: REJECTED - Issue does not exist in current implementation.

**Detailed Description**: The analysis incorrectly identified an issue with immediate cost vs cumulative cost. Verification (EXT-2025-08-19-TASK-001) confirmed that the current REINFORCE implementation in trainer.py correctly uses cumulative cost over entire trading trajectories.

**Business Impact**: NONE - Analysis was based on incorrect understanding of current implementation

**Rejection Rationale**:
✅ **Verification Complete**: EXT-2025-08-19-TASK-001 confirmed correct implementation
✅ **Technical Analysis**: Current code properly implements cumulative cost optimization
✅ **No Action Needed**: Implementation already meets theoretical requirements

**Final Status**: REJECTED - Issue Not Present

**Current Progress**:
- [x] Initial evaluation completed
- [x] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [x] Current implementation verification completed
- [x] Implementation status determined - ALREADY CORRECT
- [x] Rejection decision made based on verification results

**Dependencies**: None identified

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive A/B testing against current implementation
- Rollback plan with previous algorithm
- Performance monitoring during transition

**Success Criteria**:
- Policy learning convergence improves
- Long-term cost minimization demonstrated
- No performance regression in training time

**Owner**: TBD
**Timeline**: Target completion within 2 weeks

#### EXT-2025-08-19-AI-002: State Representation Enhancement
- **Source**: External AI Analysis (ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Category**: ARCHITECTURE + FUNCTIONALITY
- **Complexity**: MODERATE
- **Risk**: LOW
- **Effort**: 3-5 DAYS

**Summary**: Add time dependency features to policy network state representation.

**Detailed Description**: Current state representation (prev_holding, current_holding, price) lacks time dependency information. Optimal execution decisions heavily depend on remaining time in trading period. Recommendation is to add time_remaining = (T-t)/T as normalized feature.

**Business Impact**: HIGH - Enables time-aware optimal execution decisions

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Add time_remaining parameter to PolicyNetwork input
2. Update DataResult interface to include time information
3. Modify training data generation to include time features
4. Update all data loaders to provide time information
5. Test time-aware policy learning

**Current Progress**:
- [x] Initial evaluation completed
- [x] Technical approach validated
- [ ] Interface design pending
- [ ] Implementation pending
- [ ] Testing pending

**Dependencies**: 
- May depend on EXT-2025-08-19-AI-001 completion for optimal testing

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- A/B testing against time-unaware version
- Backward compatibility maintenance

**Success Criteria**:
- Policy learns time-dependent execution strategies
- Improved execution timing in end-of-period scenarios
- No degradation in non-time-critical decisions

**Owner**: TBD
**Timeline**: Target completion within 1 week after reward signal fix

#### EXT-2025-08-19-AI-003: Volatility Handling Validation
- **Source**: External AI Analysis (ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)
- **Status**: TRIAGED
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Category**: BUG_FIX + QUALITY
- **Complexity**: MODERATE
- **Risk**: MEDIUM
- **Effort**: 1 WEEK

**Summary**: Investigate and fix potential hardcoded volatility fallback in DeltaHedgeDataset.

**Detailed Description**: Analysis suggests that DeltaHedgeDataset may fall back to hardcoded volatility values when preprocessed Greeks are not available. This could lead to inaccurate Delta calculations and poor hedging performance.

**Business Impact**: MEDIUM - Affects accuracy of Greeks calculations and hedging quality

**Investigation Required**:
1. Verify if hardcoded volatility fallback actually exists in current code
2. Check preprocessed Greeks coverage and fallback scenarios  
3. Analyze impact on Delta calculation accuracy
4. Determine if issue affects current workflows

**Current Progress**:
- [x] Issue identified in external analysis
- [x] Initial triage completed
- [ ] Code investigation pending
- [ ] Impact assessment pending
- [ ] Implementation decision pending

**Dependencies**: None

**Risk Assessment**:
- May be false positive if preprocessed Greeks system handles all cases
- Could affect historical data accuracy if issue exists
- Relatively low risk if only affects edge cases

**Next Steps**:
1. Detailed code review of DeltaHedgeDataset volatility handling
2. Test preprocessed Greeks coverage across all data
3. Verify Greeks calculation accuracy
4. Determine need for fixes

**Owner**: TBD
**Timeline**: Investigation within 1 week, implementation TBD based on findings

#### EXT-2025-08-19-AI-004: Excel Parsing Robustness
- **Source**: External AI Analysis (ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)
- **Status**: TRIAGED
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Category**: QUALITY + MAINTENANCE
- **Complexity**: MODERATE
- **Risk**: LOW
- **Effort**: 1-2 WEEKS

**Summary**: Improve Excel parsing robustness by using header-based parsing instead of hardcoded cell positions.

**Detailed Description**: Current Excel parsing in weekly_options_processor.py uses hardcoded cell positions (e.g., df_raw.iloc[4], col_start + 2), making it fragile to input format changes. Recommendation is to use header-based parsing for resilience.

**Business Impact**: LOW - Improves data pipeline robustness but not critical for current research phase

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Analyze current Excel file formats and identify consistent headers
2. Develop header-based parsing logic
3. Implement fallback to current method for compatibility
4. Test with various Excel file formats
5. Update documentation

**Current Progress**:
- [x] Issue identified in external analysis
- [x] Initial triage completed
- [ ] Current implementation analysis pending
- [ ] New approach design pending
- [ ] Implementation pending

**Dependencies**: None

**Priority Justification**: 
- Low priority as current system works for available data
- Can be implemented when scaling to production
- Good engineering practice but not urgent

**Owner**: TBD
**Timeline**: Future implementation when data pipeline scaling needed

#### EXT-2025-08-19-TASK-001: Claimed Reward Signal Fix Verification
- **Source**: External Task Document (TASK_REWARD_SIGNAL_REFACTOR.md)
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Category**: VERIFICATION + BUG_FIX
- **Complexity**: SIMPLE
- **Risk**: LOW
- **Effort**: 1 DAY

**Summary**: VERIFIED - Reward signal correctly implements cumulative cost optimization.

**Detailed Description**: Verification confirmed that the external task document claim is accurate. The current implementation in trainer.py:compute_policy_loss correctly uses cumulative cost across entire trajectories, not immediate costs.

**Business Impact**: CRITICAL - Confirmed EXT-2025-08-19-AI-001 is NOT needed

**Verification Results**:
✅ **VERIFICATION COMPLETE**: Current implementation correctly implements cumulative cost
✅ **Technical Analysis**: Code properly aggregates costs across trajectories using torch.sum()
✅ **Theoretical Alignment**: Implementation meets optimal execution theory requirements
✅ **Impact Assessment**: EXT-2025-08-19-AI-001 recommendation should be rejected

**Final Status**: VERIFIED CORRECT - No additional work needed

**Current Progress**:
- [x] Inconsistency identified
- [x] Verification task created
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] Implementation status determined - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED
- [x] Gap analysis completed - NO GAPS FOUND

**Dependencies**: 
- Blocks EXT-2025-08-19-AI-001 planning until verification complete

**Critical Questions**:
- Is cumulative cost actually implemented correctly?
- What specific gaps exist in current implementation?
- How does current implementation compare to theoretical requirements?

**Owner**: TBD
**Timeline**: Verification within 1 day to unblock other work
